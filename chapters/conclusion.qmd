# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

We presented a comprehensive benchmark dataset collection for graph layout algorithms. Compiling, organizing, and making a wide array of datasets with diverse characteristics accessible not only facilitates rigorous and fair comparisons of algorithmic performance but also addresses critical issues of replicability and reproducibility in research. The Graph Benchmark Datasets website, along with the efforts for long-term archival, ensures these valuable resources remain available to the community. Web aim to help both current and future researchers to benefit from a rich repository of data, standardizing the evaluation process for graph layout algorithms, fostering innovation and development within the field and contributes to the advancement of graph drawing and visualization research. With this work, we hope to underscore the importance of accessible, well-documented benchmark datasets in driving scientific progress and highlights our commitment to enhancing the integrity and reliability of computational evaluations in the Graph Drawing community.

# Research Material Statements {#sec-research-statements}

The supplemental material for this publication includes:

* The [Graph Benchmark Datasets](https://visdunneright.github.io/gd_benchmark_sets/) website, hosted on GitHub Pages.
* Code for the website, metadata on the benchmark datasets, and data processing scripts are stored in the [gd_benchmark_sets](https://github.com/visdunneright/gd_benchmark_sets/) GitHub repository. **_TODO (CD 2024-03-08): clean up and add documentation for how to use. Esp. clean the `data` folder, `readme.md`, the random `.ipynb` files. Add `LICENCE` file specifying ideally Apache 2.0 for code, and info to `readme.md` specifying Apache 2.0 for code and CC BY 4.0 for data & metadata._**
* This code and metadata, along with the benchmark datasets themselves in several common graph file formats, are archived for long-term availability in the [Benchmark datasets for graph drawing](https://osf.io/j7ucv/) project on OSF. **_TODO  (CD 2024-03-08): add the website code + data. This can be done by creating a registration on OSF. I linked the GitHub repo as a data source on OSF, but the registration is what copies it to OSF as an archived snapshot._**
* The original database used for metadata collection and storage is available on Notion as [Benchmark datasets](https://picorana.notion.site/64e0439269f9497799025562a4087ce1?v=271e88e50ca24ee0bfd1c99ffa25daf5&pvs=74).
