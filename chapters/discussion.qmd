# Discussion, Limitations and Conclusion {#sec-discussion}

Having reliable and easy ways to compare algorithm performances on a variety of graphs with different features is an important aspect of graph drawing research. 

In this work, we presented a comprehensive benchmark dataset collection for graph layout algorithms.
Compiling, organizing, and making a wide array of datasets with diverse characteristics accessible not only facilitates rigorous and fair comparisons of algorithmic performance but also addresses critical issues of replicability and reproducibility in research.
The Graph Benchmark Datasets website, along with the efforts for long-term archival, is an effort towards maintaining these valuable resources available to the community. 

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
{
    // create a new svg
    const svg = d3.create("svg")
        .attr("viewBox", [0, 0, 500, 500])

    for (let i in benchmark_datasets){
        const dataset = benchmark_datasets[i]

        console.log(dataset)
        
        svg.append("text")
            .attr("x", 100)
            .attr("y", i * 20 + 10)
            .attr("font-size", "x-small")
            .attr("text-anchor", "end")
            .text(dataset.Name)
    }

    return svg.node();
}
```

The work we did for the collection process doesn't come without **limitations**.
We focused on the Graph Drawing conference as the main venue to begin collecting papers, which limits the completeness of our search.
There could be many relevant datasets that we did not find to include here.
Indeed, in no way we consider this collection comprehensive, but rather a starting point .
